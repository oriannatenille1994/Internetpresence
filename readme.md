# InternetPresence
Have you ever wanted to see your internet presence in full? Well, now you can do so, in an easy-to-do manner!

## How to find Usernames
For this, just run `username.bat`. It'll install everything you need, and then clean itself up afterwards.

You can search for either one username, or multiple. When doing multiple, make sure to break them up by using spaces instead of newlines since it is batch.

If you've done multiple, you can see all of the accounts in `username/NAME.txt`, or if you did a single one, see `username.txt`.

## How to find Emails
To do this, run `py email.py`. If you do not have `holehe` installed, please install it using [https://github.com/megadose/holehe#with-github](https://github.com/megadose/holehe#with-github)

It'll ask you for Phone Numbers until you say one of these: `n`, `N`, `no`, `No`. Make sure to do newlines after each one unlike for usernames.

The output will go to `phone.txt`.
